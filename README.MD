# Elasticsearch Course Search API

This Spring Boot project demonstrates a course search API using Elasticsearch.
It supports full-text search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and (bonus) autocomplete and fuzzy matching.

## Features

- Bulk indexing of sample course data into Elasticsearch
- REST API to search with filters:
    - Age, category, price, type, and date
- Sorting (by session date or price)
- Pagination support
- (Bonus) Autocomplete & fuzzy search on course titles

---

## Tech Stack

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot 3.4.7
- Spring Data Elasticsearch
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Elasticsearch 7.17

## Getting Started

### 1âƒ£ Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahnissingh/elasticsearch-course-search.git
cd elasticsearch-course-search
```

### Start Elasticsearch Locally

This project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file that launches a single-node Elasticsearch cluster (v7.17.10) without
authentication.

To start Elasticsearch:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### To verify that it is running:

```bash
 curl http://localhost:9200
```

### You should see a response like:
```json
{
  "name": "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_name": "docker-cluster",
  "version": {
    "number": "7.17.10"
  }
}
```
Elasticsearch is now accessible at: http://localhost:9200


## ðŸ“¦ Sample Data Ingestion

On application startup, the application automatically reads and indexes course data from the [`sample-courses.json`](src/main/resources/sample-courses.json) file into Elasticsearch.

### âœ… How It Works

- The file `sample-courses.json` located under `src/main/resources` contains 50+ sample course entries.
- A Spring `ApplicationRunner` component loads this file at startup and bulk-indexes all documents into the `courses` index in Elasticsearch.
- > The JSON filename can also be configured via `app.data.courses-file` in `application.yml` (must be a valid JSON file).


### ðŸ”„ Triggering Data Ingestion

Simply run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
### Optional: Clearing Existing Data

If you want the application to clear existing course data from Elasticsearch before loading fresh data from `sample-courses.json`, you can enable the following configuration:

```yaml
# application.yml
app:
  data:
    clear-data: true
